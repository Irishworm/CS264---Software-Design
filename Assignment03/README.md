Using Memento Design Pattern

You	are	required	to	design	and	develop	an	interactive	(command	line)	user	interface	for	the	console	applicaCon	that	you	developed	in	Assignment	02.	The	user	interface	should	provide	simple	keyboard	functionality	 to	:

(i)	 generate	 different	 random	 shapes	 that	are	added	 to	 the	 canvas,	 

(ii)	 display	 the	current	canvas	to	the	console,	

(iii)	save	the	canvas	to	a	file,	

(iv)	implement	Undo-Redo	funcConality	in	your	interactive	session.
